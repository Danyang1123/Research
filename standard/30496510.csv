125,"Some possible limitations of our study could be 1) the exclusion of patients with severe thoracic trauma or the presence of complications due to the more difficult evaluation of the pain and the other parameters of the study as these patients usually present with severe multiple traumas that require sedation and mechanical ventilation with prolonged admissions; 2) the chance that some RFs were not included in the treatment area, but the homogeneity of both groups highly reduced this possibility.",0,0,0,N,0,0,0,0,N,0,0
