0,Aims To determine if screening with an ultrasound A-scan and prophylactic treatment of primary angle closure (PAC) with laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) can reduce the incidence of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in Mongolia.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
1,Methods A single-masked randomised controlled trial was initiated in 1999.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
2,"4725 volunteer Mongolian participants ≥50 years old from the capital Ulaanbaatar or the rural province of Bayankhongor were recruited, of which 128 were excluded with glaucoma.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
3,"4597 were randomly allocated to the control, no-screening arm or screening with ultrasound central anterior chamber depth (cACD), with the cut-off set at <2.53 mm.",N,1,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
4,"685 screen-positive participants were examined and angle closure was identified by gonioscopy in 160, of which 156 were treated with prophylactic LPI.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
5,"Primary outcome of incident PACG was determined using both structural and functional evidence from objective grading of paired disc photographs from baseline and follow-up, objective grading of follow-up visual fields and clinical examination.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N

7,"In an intention to treat analysis using available data, PACG was diagnosed in 33 participants (1.61%, 95% CI 1.11% to 2.25%), of which 19 were in the screened group and 14 in the non-screened group (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.60, p=0.47), indicating no difference between groups.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N

11,"Chronic PACG is the more prevalent form of the disease, with only a third having a history of an acute episode.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
12,Historical studies have shown that prophylactic peripheral iridotomy can prevent acute angle closure (AAC) in fellow eyes.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
13,"More recent studies have also demonstrated that laser iridotomy can stabilise elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in non-glaucomatous eyes with occludable angles and primary angle closure (PAC).Therefore, early detection and treatment can potentially reduce the incidence of PACG.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
14,A shallow central anterior chamber depth (cACD) is a strong risk factor for PAC in populations with a high prevalence of PACG.Measurement of cACD is effective in detecting occludable angles and PAC when compared with gonioscopy.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
15,Occludable angles and PAC therefore fulfil many of the Wilson–Jungner criteria for screening.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N

146,"Previous studies which have explored screening with ACD include an observational study from Greenland.Alsbirk identified occludable angles in 20/69 participants based on a cumulative Shaffer grade <8, which is less stringent than the present ISGEO criteria.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N
