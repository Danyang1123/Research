128,"Another in vitro study on human endothelial cell culture has shown that bevacizumab and ranibizumab similarly targeted several steps required during the angiogenic process, namely endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and assembly into capillary-like structures.Furthermore, when looking at the various clinical studies in the management of myopic CNV,stability or improvement of visual function has been similarly obtained in about 90% to 95% of eyes treated by ranibizumab or bevacizumab.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0
129,Lai and associates recently reported the 1-year outcomes of 16 eyes that had intravitreal ranibizumab as primary treatment of myopic CNV.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0

136,The relative cost benefit of ranibizumab versus bevacizumab in clinical practice remains controversial27 because of the enormous difference in cost between the 2 drugs and since no indirect clinical comparisons to date have revealed any significant differences in efficacy between both treatments.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0

141,"In addition, pigment epithelial detachments are almost negligible in myopic lesions.Hence, CNV associated with AMD might show a different clinical response to the 2 drugs, confirming the postulated higher penetration ability of ranibizumab.Recently, a head-to-head trial has been funded by the National Eye Institute (Bethesda, Maryland, USA) to directly compare ranibizumab and bevacizumab for the treatment of exudative AMD, the results of which might take us closer to resolving this issue.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0
