128,"Although the patients in our study received a more frequent regimen of steroid treatment, we did not observe any significant rise in the IOP that necessitated antiglaucoma medication, which is assumed to be the result of both the short duration of treatment and a lower secretion of aqueous during inflammation.",0,0,N,0,N,0,0,0,N,0,0
129,"Although several clinical trials have compared different preserved topical steroid preparations for the treatment of anterior uveitis,this is the first study that evaluates and compares the efficacy and safety profile of nonpreserved methylprednisolone topical treatment.",0,0,N,0,N,0,0,0,N,0,0
130,The strengths of this study include its rather uniform target population and the use of robust methods for ascertaining clinical outcomes.,0,0,N,0,N,0,0,0,N,0,0
131,We only included patients with pure anterior uveitis (idiopathic and HLA B27 related) to provide a more uniform population for comparison.,0,0,N,0,N,0,0,0,N,0,0
132,"Besides, patients with severe inflammation (including patients with hypopyon or fibrin formation) and those who did not respond to topical treatment in previous episodes were excluded because it was deemed unethical to subject them to a treatment regimen that is most likely not effective.",0,0,N,0,N,0,0,0,N,0,0

134,"As in other clinical studies, there are some limitations with our study that should be addressed: First, the sample size is rather small.",0,0,N,0,N,0,0,0,N,0,0
