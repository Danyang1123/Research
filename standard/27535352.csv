70,"It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with its peak level reaching in 60–90 min, and having a half-ife between 9–12 h. It causes vasoconstriction by acting on post-junctional α2 receptors, and hypotension and bradycardia through its sympatholytic effect.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N

87,Clonidine is better than other peripheral vasoconstrictors in several ways.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
88,"Firstly, topical vasoconstrictors act only on nasal mucosa, while clonidine acts on nasal, sphenoidal and gland in the pituitary surgery.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
89,"Secondly, adrenaline is contraindicated in situations like history of hypertension, arrhythmias, angina, myocardial infarction, and when halothane is used as an inhalational agent; in these conditions, clonidine is safe.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
90,"Studies have shown clonidine to decrease the mucosal blood flow in animal models,thereby resulting in decreased secretory activity of mucosa.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
