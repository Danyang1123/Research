8,"However, benefits are not restricted to physical health alone but extend to the psychological domain of health as well.",0,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N,N
9,Longitudinal epidemiological studies have shown that a high level of physical activity reduces the risk of developing high depressive symptomatology over time (Farmer et al.,0,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N,N

15,Other experimental studies have shown that an exercise program appears to be at least as effective in reducing clinical depression as more conventional treatment regimens like antidepressant medication (Babyak et al.,0,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,0,N,N
