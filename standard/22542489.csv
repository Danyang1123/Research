136,"The findings of this study support our hypothesis and suggest that exercise-induced changes in motor performance in patients with MNP are dependent on the mode of the exercise intervention, with modest improvement to other domains of motor function that are not representative of the primary behavioral demand of the exercise.",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N

142,"The observed improvements were most evident in the higher intensity levels (28 and 30mmHg) of the test (see Fig 3, Fig 4), consistent with previous reports of greater differences in muscle activity in patients with neck pain compared with controls in these higher levels of the test.",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N
143,"Despite the CTr group acquiring larger changes in coordination (particularly measures from the SCM muscle) compared with the other groups, this group attained a negligible change in strength (see table 2) and modest improvements in endurance (11%–23% increase).",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N
144,"Interestingly, these improvements were not as high as in a previous study in our laboratory investigating the CTr protocol in MNP in which participants attained an 11% and 37% improvement in strength and endurance, respectively, using a similar dynamometry measurement protocol.",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N

149,"The findings of this study are consistent with observations from mechanistic studies that indicate that neuronal, muscle, and functional changes after training are dependent on the specific behavioral demands of the training tasks.For example, a review by Adkins et al1 has described specific neuronal adaptations to training that are dependent on whether the training is focused on skill acquisition (enhanced synaptic formation, altered motor cortex movement representations), endurance training (altered formation of blood vessels in motor cortex, no alteration in motor map organization or synapses), or strength training (altered spinal motoneuron excitability, enhanced synaptic formation within spinal cord, no effect on motor map organization).",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N
150,"Similarly, different responses in muscle have been described in response to endurance training (increased mitochondrial density, increased capillary density, and fiber transition from fast to slow) to that for strength training (stimulates synthesis of contractile proteins responsible for muscle hypertrophy and increases in maximal contractile force output).These mechanistic studies provide some insight into the physiologic mechanisms that potentially underlie the exercise mode–specific adaptations observed in our study, particularly in response to the CTr (large component of skill training) and ETr protocols.",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N

155,"It is interesting to speculate that the CTr exercises, which involve gentle repeated and sustained upper cervical flexions, may improve flexion mobility by inducing changes in the posterior soft tissue elements of the cervical spine, such as, for example, relaxation in tone of the extensor muscles or hysteresis of noncontractile tissues.",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N

160,"Comparison of these exercise conditions with respect to their impact on pain and disability should be made with caution because of the inclusion of participants with only mild levels of self-reported neck disability (participants' scores of <15 of a possible 50 points), which was a purposeful inclusion criterion to avoid potential aggravation of neck symptoms (and potential subsequent losses to follow-up) from the exercise programs in this relatively small trial investigating training-induced motor effects.",N,0,N,N,N,N,0,N,N,N,N
