49,The primary outcome measured was whether or not the chalazion had completely resolved.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
50,Complete resolution was defined as no longer having a palpable lesion at the location of the original chalazion.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N

58,Telephone questionnaires were used because of high failure rates of patients attending follow‐up appointments previously noted in our minor operations clinic.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
59,"Fortunately, no patients were lost to follow up.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
60,We used a simplified version of the 11‐point Numerical Rating Scale whereby patients were asked to rate the level of pain they experienced during the treatment they underwent for their chalazia and over the hours and days following the treatment.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
61,Patients were asked to score their overall experience of pain on a scale of 0 to 10 whereby 0 meant that no pain was experienced whatsoever and 10 equalled ‘the worst pain they had ever experienced’.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
62,"For simplicity, a scale of 0 to 5 was used to score questions two and three of the secondary outcome measures whereby 0 was equivalent to ‘no inconvenience caused’ for question two, or ‘completely unsatisfied with the treatment’ for question three.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
63,"Conversely, a score of 5 signified that the treatment and aftercare incurred ‘excessive inconvenience to the patient’ (for question two) and ‘complete satisfaction with the treatment and aftercare’ (for question three) (Table 3).",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
64,Patients who reported that their chalazion had completely resolved after their first treatment were discharged.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
65,"All the remaining patients (including those patients whose chalazia had partially resolved) were offered a 3‐week follow‐up appointment (6 weeks after their first treatment) for a repeat of their original treatment, apart from patients who had been assigned to conservative treatment.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
66,These patients were retreated by I&C at this second clinic appointment and were followed up 3 weeks later via a second telephone call (at 9 weeks).,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
67,"If the chalazion had still not resolved by this point, these patients were booked into an oculoplastics clinic for assessment and further management of the chalazion.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
68,2 for a summary of this treatment pathway.),N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
69,"Patients with more than one chalazion on the same eyelid were excluded from the study but patients with more than one chalazion, each on different eyelids, were included in the study and were assigned to one of the three treatments to treat all their chalazia.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
70,"The rationale behind this is first, that treating chalazia in close proximity to one another might introduce a confounding factor into the study, influencing resolution outcomes.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
71,"Second, patients with multiple chalazia suitable for inclusion in the study had to receive the same treatment for all their chalazia, otherwise it would not have been possible for them to score the secondary outcomes regarding inconvenience caused by their treatment and aftercare and their overall satisfaction with their treatment.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
72,"However, in order to enable an independent samples comparison, even if a patient was treated for multiple chalazia, he or she was included as one sample in the cohort.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
73,Such patients therefore had to be excluded from the study if the outcomes of the treatments on different eyelids were variable.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
74,"There were four outcome variables, the primary outcome being whether the chalazia had resolved and three secondary outcomes (detailed as described earlier), namely: the patient's pain experience, the inconvenience caused to the patient and the patient's overall satisfaction with the treatment.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
75,"Whether the chalazia had resolved was measured as either yes or no, and can be viewed as a categorical variable.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
76,The chi‐squared test was used to compare if there was an overall difference in the outcomes between the three groups.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
77,"Subsequently, the chi‐squared test was also used to examine if there was a difference between any two treatment groups.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
78,"These subsequent analyses required further statistical tests, and because several comparisons between groups were made there was more chance of finding a difference between treatments due to chance.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
79,"Therefore, this was accounted for by performing a Bonferroni correction to the analysis results.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
80,This involved multiplying the P‐values resulting from each test by the number of comparisons made (three in this case).,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
81,"The other three outcomes, patient pain, inconvenience and satisfaction, were measured on an ordinal scale.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
82,"Therefore, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the overall difference in scores between the three groups.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
83,"Subsequently, the Mann–Whitney test was used to compare between pairs of treatments.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
84,Again a Bonferroni correction was applied to allow for the fact that several comparisons are made.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
85,The significance of the results was determined from the P‐values which result from each analysis.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
86,A P‐value of <0.05 was usually regarded as evidence of a statistically significant result.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
87,"The results showed a significant difference in chalazion resolution between H/C group and each of the other two groups, but no significant difference between the TA and I&C groups.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
88,"After a single treatment session, the TA and I&C groups performed the best with 84% (47/56) and 87% (39/45) of chalazia resolved in each group, respectively, compared with only 46% (16/35) in the H/C group.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
89,"Of the remaining 16% (9/56) of patients whose first TA injection was unsuccessful, a further three chalazia resolved after a second TA injection, increasing the overall resolution rate with TA to 89% (50/56) in this treatment group.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
90,The remaining six patients in the TA group were then treated successfully by I&C in the oculoplastics clinic.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
91,The resolution rate increased to 100% (45/45) in the I&C group after a second treatment and therefore none of these patients needed to be referred to the oculoplastics clinic.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
92,All patients in the H/C group whose chalazia remained unresolved at their telephone follow up (19/35) were given follow‐up appointments for I&C of their chalazia.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
93,Seventeen of these 19 patients subsequently underwent successful I&C with complete resolution of their chalazia and the remaining two were lost to follow up after referral to the oculoplastics clinic.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
94,Chalazion resolution rates and the median as well as interquartile ranges of the other outcomes measured are summarized in Table 4.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
95,Specific comparisons between pairs of groups were made using the chi‐squared test for chalazion resolution and the Mann–Whitney test for all other outcomes.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
96,These results are summarized in Table 5.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
97,The figures presented the Bonferroni‐adjusted P‐values for each pairwise comparison.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N

100,Pain experienced during and after treatment,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
101,There was a significant difference in pain between all pairs of treatment groups.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
102,"The pain scores were highest in the I&C group with a median score of 7, followed by a median score of 6 in the TA group and lowest in the H/C group with a median score of 0.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
103,There was a significant difference in pain scores reported by the I&C group compared with the TA group which was statistically significant (P = 0.003).,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
104,The results for inconvenience indicated that there was a significant difference between the TA group and each of the other two groups.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
105,"The TA group had the lowest inconvenience scores, with a median value of 2 in this group.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
106,There was no evidence of a significant difference in inconvenience between the H/C and I&C groups.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
107,"The median scores for these two groups were 4 and 3, respectively.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
108,There was a significant difference in satisfaction between the H/C treatment group and each of the other two groups.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
109,"The H/C group had a median satisfaction score of 2, which was significantly lower than the TA and I&C groups, which both had a median score of 4.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
110,"None of the patients reported any adverse events such as skin depigmentation, decreased vision from globe penetration or significant haemorrhage following either I&C or TA injections.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
111,"The results of this study suggest that a single transconjunctival 0.2‐mL injection of 10 mg/mL of TA followed by repeated digital massage at home, has efficacy comparable with I&C in the treatment of chalazia and with similar patient satisfaction and less pain and patient inconvenience.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
112,Incision and curettage of chalazia is one of the most common minor operations performed in ophthalmology departments and is often a ‘one‐stop’ procedure on the day of the patient's first outpatient visit.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
113,"In practice we found that many patients were not prepared to undergo an operative procedure the same day, or drove to the eye clinic so could not have their eye padded afterwards and had to rebook their appointment for the procedure with implications on resource management.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
114,"Moreover, chalazia tend to occur in a younger age group who may have a substantial psychological aversion to surgery (which involves an anaesthetic injection plus the surgical procedure) as opposed to an injection only.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
115,A Canadian survey of ophthalmologists had suggested that chalazion surgery should not be trivialized and should be treated with the same respect as any other ocular surgery.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
116,"Previous studies had suggested that TA injections, although effective frequently, needed to be repeated before complete chalazion resolution is achieved.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
117,Multiple injections would affect the convenience of and pain induced by the treatment.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
118,"Conservative treatment with H/C is unlikely to induce pain but has a significantly lower resolution rate, and the treatment may impact on the lifestyle of the typical younger busy/employed patient who may have difficulty in complying with the treatment.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
119,"We have attempted to quantify these elements by incorporating this into our follow‐up questionnaire in asking the patients about inconvenience of treatment, the experience throughout the procedure and the subsequent recovery, Numerical Rating Scores were used to measure these outcomes as this method was found to be superior in a previous study comparing it with the Visual Analogue Scale and the Verbal Rating Scale.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
120,"The study deemed the Numerical Rating Scale to be superior in measuring outcomes such as pain in treatment evaluative trials because of its ease of scoring for patients, a numerical system being easy to analyse and because it was found to yield consistent results.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
121,The transconjunctival route of TA injection was also found to be safe as this route appears to avoid localized skin depigmentation or inadvertent penetration of the globe.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
122,"Ho documented that two out of the 48 patients that underwent subcutaneous intralesional triamcinolone injection were affected by localized skin depigmentation whereas in our study, none of the 56 patients that underwent this procedure suffered this adverse effect.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
123,"Our cohort consisted of patients with a variety of skin pigmentations, of whom at least 50% were Afro Caribbean or Asian.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
124,"Therefore, this study supports the notion that the transconjunctival route of TA injection minimizes the risk of localized skin depigmentation.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
125,"One possible explanation for this could be that although the injection is aimed at being deposited intralesionally, occasionally a small portion of TA may be deposited by the needle on the way in or out of the injection site.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
126,Previous studies investigating the efficacy of TA in the treatment of chalazia have used varying concentrations of the drug.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
127,"Whereas in Ho's study, the concentration of TA used was 10 mg/mL, in Simon et al.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
128,"'s study, a dilution of 40 mg/mL was used injected.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
129,We opted to use the lower concentration of steroid in our study.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
130,"The rationale for this is that by using the minimal therapeutic concentration of TA, we would minimize the risk of localized skin depigmentation in a cohort which we expected to be multiethnic, reflecting the local population.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
131,"Indeed, an even lower concentration of injected TA (5 mg/mL) has been reported as being efficacious in a previous smaller study.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
132,Further studies investigating how the efficacy of intralesional triamcinolone varies with different concentrations are required to answer this important question.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
133,The 46% baseline resolution rate in the conservative group was consistent with previous reports of chalazia resolution without medical or surgical intervention.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
134,Resolution of chalazia through this management option may indeed depend on the chronicity of a chalazion before H/C are applied.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
135,"To date, there are no published surveys investigating this.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
136,The use of antibiotic ointment containing steroid was not investigated as one of the treatment options in this study.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
137,"Although topical steroid ointment may theoretically penetrate the chalazia by infiltrating through the conjunctiva into the tarsal plate, this would also inadvertently significantly increase the risk of raised IOP in a cohort of patients whose IOP was not specifically being followed up.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
138,The lower pain and inconvenience levels reported by the TA group compared with the I&C group are indicative of its patient friendliness.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
139,The pain scores were taken 3 weeks after the intervention in order that the postoperative/post‐injection pain was included in this scoring.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
140,"Unfortunately, this may have meant that the score may have been influenced by whether the treatment was successful.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
141,Chalazia mimicking malignant lesions such as sebaceous cell carcinoma have been well described but fortunately are extremely rare.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
142,"Although largely unknown, the effect of injecting steroid erroneously into a sebaceous cell carcinoma could, at worse, mask its presence leading to a delayed or even missed diagnosis and, in turn, a disastrous clinical outcome!",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
143,"Therefore, it is important to ensure that all chalazia being considered for TA injection have no atypical features.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
144,"In addition to having a resolution rate comparable with conventional I&C, triamcinolone injections theoretically avoid excessive bruising of the lid as it is far less traumatic.",N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
145,Not needing an eye‐pad post treatment means that patients can drive and resume their daily activities almost immediately following treatment.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
146,Intralesional triamcinolone injections for chalazia have obvious economic and practical advantages for the health‐care provider as its cost in time and equipment is a fraction of that for conventional surgical treatment.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
147,TA injections are therefore a good first‐line treatment option for uncomplicated chalazia and could be administered by trained nurse practitioners in the eye clinic or even in a primary health‐care setting.,N,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N
