231,An interesting caveat to the long latent period before IOP elevation in patients treated with PA as frequently as q1hWA is that treatment with PA for periods of 16 weeks or less will not identify at least 50% of patients at risk for steroid-induced glaucoma and probably is not an ideal screening tool to identify patients who have minimal risk of problems with increased IOP after injection of fluocinolone acetate implants.,0,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0
232,"Difluprednate ophthalmic emulsion 0.05% (Sirion Therapeutics, Tampa, Florida, USA) is a relatively new topical steroid that, when administered qid, was found to equal efficacy to PA administered 8 times a day in the treatment of anterior uveitis, but it may be associated with more frequent and more severe increases in IOP.",0,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0

236,"Visual benefits were similar in POSME compared with PCSME; and for both subgroups, subjects who had residual edema after 12 weeks of PA qid + ketorolac qid had rapid improvement and resolution of edema after switching to PA q1hWA + ketorolac qid.",0,0,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,0
